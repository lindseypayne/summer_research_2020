    "\n",
    "- Yes. the one Oscar is working but complimentary. I am not super clear yet but let me try to explain. As we don't know how the QE variation affects in science product, investigating the correlation between QE variation -- flat with spot is interesting. Thinking about the spot, you have measurements of flux (zero-th), positions (1st), and shape (2nd moments). So you can correlate those measurements with QE variations. Suppose we are going to compare flux f a function of positions against QE variation Q (as a function of positions), we can calculate correlation coefficient r =<df dQ>/(<df^2><dQ^2>) using deviations df, dQ from mean numbers <f>, <Q> . \n",
    "- If there is the correlation, r will be a non-zero value and vice versa. You could repeat this analysis with positional differences from fiducial as a function of positions, shapes as a function of positions.\n",
    "But what I am not clear is how we say whether if it is significant or not. We should evaluate noise level in r but I haven't had a clear view how we evaluate noise level, but eventually I'll come up with some idea hopefully? Probably we could use typical methods -- bootstrap or jackknife but I am not super clear. "
